# Flask CRM Application

(A more detailed description of the CRM application will be added here.)

## Features

(List key features of the application here.)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Installation & Local Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (if `.env.example` is provided) or create a new `.env` file.
    *   Set the following variables:
        *   `SECRET_KEY`: A strong secret key for Flask session management.
        *   `DATABASE_URL` (Optional for local SQLite): If you want to use a database other than the default `sqlite:///app.db`, provide its connection string here (e.g., for PostgreSQL).

5.  **Initialize the Database (if using default SQLite or setting up a new database):**
    *   If you are using Flask-Migrate (check `DEPLOYMENT_ON_VERCEL.md` for initialization steps if the `migrations` folder is missing):
        ```bash
        # flask db init  (Run once if migrations folder is not present)
        # flask db migrate -m "Initial setup" 
        flask db upgrade
        ```
    *   The application also runs `db.create_all()` on startup, which can create tables for SQLite if migrations are not yet set up.

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application should be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
